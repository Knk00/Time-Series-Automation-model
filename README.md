# Time-Series-Automation-model
This repo contains methods and automation that I implmented for a Demand Forcasting project. The goal of the project was to forecast the Sales. For this, I developed an 
Automation  model that forecasts based on a given time series. The model consists of models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters and others.
